things we have tried:

upper/lowercase/title
append/prepend random letters/symbols/numbers
permutations of capitalizing each letter
common letter/number substitutions
above two combined for each letter permutation

they might change case, prepend and/or append additional letters, numbers, or symbols, and/or make common letter/symbol or letter/number substitutions. 

possible:
* change case
* prepend lns
* append lns
* prepend and append lns
